# Vercel Deployment Issue Explanation

## Why Streamlit Apps Don't Work Well on Vercel

The "404 deployment not found" error occurs because **Streamlit apps are not compatible with Vercel's serverless architecture**. Here's why:

1. **Serverless vs. Server-based**: Vercel uses a serverless architecture where functions start and stop for each request. Streamlit apps require a continuously running server.

2. **Long-running processes**: Streamlit apps need to maintain state and run continuously, which conflicts with Vercel's model of spinning up and down containers for each request.

3. **Port requirements**: Vercel expects applications to respond immediately to HTTP requests, but Streamlit takes time to start up.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (Recommended)
This is the easiest solution:
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Streamlit will automatically deploy your app

### Option 2: Use Docker-based Deployment
Create a Dockerfile and deploy to a platform that supports containers:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "influencer_dashboard.py"]
```

### Option 3: Convert to Static Dashboard
Export your dashboard as HTML and serve it statically:
1. Use Streamlit's `streamlit run influencer_dashboard.py --server.headless=true` to generate reports
2. Export visualizations as images or HTML
3. Create a static website with the exported content

### Option 4: Use Alternative Hosting
Platforms that work better with Streamlit:
- Heroku
- Render
- Railway
- PythonAnywhere

## Current Repository Status
Your repository is properly configured with all necessary files:
- `influencer_dashboard.py` - Main application
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- Sample CSV files for demonstration
- All data processing logic implemented

The application works perfectly when run locally with:
```bash
streamlit run influencer_dashboard.py
```
