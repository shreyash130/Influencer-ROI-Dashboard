# Changes Made for Vercel Deployment

## 1. Created vercel.json
Added a `vercel.json` configuration file with the necessary build settings for Python apps:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "app.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python",
      "config": {
        "runtime": "python3.9"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "app.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Created app.py
Added an entry point for Vercel that properly runs the Streamlit app:
```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the Streamlit app
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "streamlit", "run", "influencer_dashboard.py", "--server.port", "8080", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0"])
```

## 3. Modified influencer_dashboard.py
Made the following key changes to make the app work on Vercel:

1. **Added sample data loading**: When no files are uploaded, the app now loads sample data for demonstration purposes
2. **Added fallback data creation**: If sample CSV files are not found, the app creates minimal demo data
3. **Added informative messages**: Shows helpful messages to users about the demo mode
4. **Imported os module**: To check for the existence of sample files

## 4. Created .vercelignore
Added a comprehensive ignore file to exclude unnecessary files from Vercel deployment.

## 5. Updated README.md
Enhanced the README with specific Vercel deployment instructions.

## 6. Kept existing requirements.txt
Verified that the existing requirements.txt is compatible with Vercel.

## How it works on Vercel
When deployed to Vercel:
1. Vercel uses app.py as the entry point
2. Dependencies are automatically installed from requirements.txt
3. The Streamlit app runs on port 8080 as required by Vercel
4. Users can still upload their own CSV files if they want
5. If no files are uploaded, the app automatically loads sample data
6. The dashboard functions exactly the same way with either uploaded or sample data

This makes the app perfect for both development and production use on Vercel.
